# Developer Tool – Contentstack Extension

#### About this extension
The “Developer Tools” extension provides developers with quick tools (API endpoint, JSON, etc.) to work with an entry or all entries of a content type and do a lot more. 

The Developer Tools widget extension, which can be accessed on the right-hand side of the entry page, primarily has two tabs: API Details and JSON View.

#### 1. API Details: 
This tab provides the REST API endpoints or queries (in any language of your choice) that you can readily use to access/fetch the current entry or all entries of the content type. You need to select the Platform, copy the endpoint/query, add the environment name, and use it as required to fetch the entry.

#### 2.JSON View: 
The JSON view tab displays the JSON data of your entry. You can then copy this JSON and use it as per requirement or import it to other content types.
